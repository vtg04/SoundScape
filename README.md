# SoundScape : 
Spatial Audio Experience that can be integrated in any kind of particular environment providing us a real time audio ambience of sounds such as traffic, trains , human interaction , nature sounds etc.
This can be integrated in Google Earth Engine which already consists of street and flight view of different location on earth. Additionally, we can add audio aspect to it also providing us a real time experience of being virtually present in that location.
